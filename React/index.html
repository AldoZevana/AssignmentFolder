<!-- Then, after the React scripts load, our browser executes the script that will call the method ReactDOM.render.
    This method will overwrite what we originally had in the div with id root with an h1 that contains "Our First React page has rendered". 
    If you continue to refresh your page, you can see it quickly change. Congratulations! You have created your first React project. -->
